# media-cleaner-python-broken
Completely broken. Don't use this. WIP. You can help if you want though lol

This is a 100% AI assisted yoink and twist of this repo: https://github.com/Supergamer1337/media-cleaner

I want to make that repo work for Jellyfin and Ombi instead of Plex, Overseerr and Tautulli. I understand ZERO Rust so now I've used AI to convert each file to Python. It's managed to do a decent job from what I can tell, but there is a lot to do especially in the main.py script. 

Any assistance from literally anyone of any skill level will be reviewed and likely implemented. 

kthanksbye
